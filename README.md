helpppp
can you help me with the indeksertliste and prioritetskoe? The indexed list is supposed to treat the linked list like it has indexes so that you can add and remove at given positions,
the prioroty is supposed to use the comparable to check for the smallest number so that the list is ascending. There are test files from my teacher but they dont work so i think there
is something wrong with my code. Also, we can't use packages or imports. thank you sooo much
